# HyperCompass

**HyperCompass** is a personal project aimed at building a comprehensive dashboard for investors in the Hyperliquid ecosystem.  
The application will serve as a portfolio piece for job opportunities, while also laying the groundwork for a potential future product that could be monetized.

- Provide investors with clear insights, tools, and visualizations.  
- Develop a modular structure to expand over time.
